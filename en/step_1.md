## What you will make

Make your own stop motion animation video using a Raspberry Pi, Python and a camera module to take pictures, controlled by a push button connected to the Pi's GPIO pins.

You can use LEGO to animate a tower being built, figures acting out a scene, or anything else you can think of!
